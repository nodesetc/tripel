eventually, this project will let you:
* create hierarchical category structures.
* create writeups under said category structures.
* create comment threads under categories or under writeups.
* watch writeups and comments in a graph-based way to be alerted about new developments.

unfortunately, at present, all you can do is:
* login.
* create "nodespaces".
* invite new users.
* create categories from the python interpreter (which you'll also need to use to create your first user).
* run a set of unit tests which is no longer comprehensive.

but development is ongoing, and something useful should be here soon, hopefully.  stay tuned.
